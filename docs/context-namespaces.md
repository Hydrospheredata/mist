## Context namespaces

Mist creates and orchestrates Apache Spark contexts automatically. All created contexts have their own namespace. Every job is run in a namespace. In fact namespace describes a named Spark context and Mist settings for this Spark context. For reasons of simplicity namespace is an arbitrary string which is specified by user e.g. `foo`, `report`, `forecast_only_namespace`.

By default when you request a job to run the first time, Mist creates a namespace and new Spark context. The second request will use the created namespace so the context will be alive while Mist is running. This behavior can be changed in the [configuration](configuration.md): `mist.contextSetting.onstart` allows you to specify namespaces which must be run on start; `disposable` setting kills the context right after using it. 

You can set up options either for all contexts (`mist.context-defaults`) or for each context individually (`mist.context.<namespace>`) including [spark settings](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration.html) (`mist.context.<namespace>.spark-conf`)
