### Reactive API

For reactive api mist supports MQTT and Kafka.
You can run jobs and consume job-event from Mist.
By default it is turned off. Check out [configuration](/mist-docs/configuration.html) to see how to turn it on.

Run-job request is json message and should has following format:
```js
{
  "functionId": "functionId",
  "parameters": {"foo": "bar"}, // job arguments
  "externalId": "myId" // optional
}
```
Then you can listen `publish-topic` to catch events from the job

#### Lifecycle events

There were several async interfaces described bellow, that can be used to track lifecycle events from jobs.
All events have 2 required fields: `event`, `id`, and some of them provide more:
```js
{
  "event": "event-name",
  "id": "job id"
}
```

- `initialized` - job has been assigned to invocation, also returns all job parameters
- `queued` - job has been queued (wait before worker assign job)
- `started` - job has been sent to worker
- `canceled` - job has been canceled by user
- `finished`- job has been finished successfully, also has `result` field
- `failed` - job has been finished unsuccessfully, also has `error` field
- `logs` - job produced some log messages

#### Websocket

For new UI there is a websocket interface for listening to lifecycle events from jobs
Events are sent to the client to the following paths:
- `/v2/api/ws` - subscribe to all events from mist
- `/v2/api/jobs/{id}/ws` - subscribe to events from particular job
